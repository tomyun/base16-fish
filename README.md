## FAQ
1. Why not just use [base16-shell](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell)?

`base16-shell` is great for bash/zsh, but unable to support [syntax highlighting colors](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/index.html#variables-color) in fish that ends up with incorrect coloring of texts typed in the prompt. `base16-fish` fixes this problem by explicitly setting color variables in native fish shell scripts. With that, no separate helper required in `config.fish`. No configuration file (`.base16_theme`) stored in your home directory. Theme switching commands (`base16-*`) are now fish functions that work more nicely with tab completetion.
